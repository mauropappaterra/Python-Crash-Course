############################################ IF STATEMENTS
# Refer to booleans.py before reading this

#1
if (True): # iff whatever is in () happens to be true
    print("This will be executed.") # whatever line here will be executed

if True: # parenthesis are not necessary
    print("Yes.")

#2
if (True and True): # we can check multiple simultaneously statements using 'and'
    print("This too.")
#3
if (True and False):
    print("Not this.")
#4
if (True or False): # we can also check multiple simultaneously statements using 'or'
    print("This will do.")
#5
if ((True or False) and True): # we can also nest 'or' and 'and' statement as many times as we want
    print("This will do too.")

############################################ IF ELSE STATEMENTS

if (False): # iff what ever is in () is not True
    print ("This line will never be printed")
else:
    print("This will be executed instead") # whatever line here will be executed instead
